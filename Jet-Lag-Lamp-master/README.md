# Introduction to the AmI
The AmI system **senses** from where the user came from and where is the destination point (starting time slot and arriving time slot). It gets information of the _sleep quality_ of the user and his way of sleeping (avg time of deep sleep, avg time of REM time, avg time of sleep, typical bedtime and wake-up time). The AmI understand as well the user’s appointments during the day.</br>
Knowing all these informations the AmI system is able to **calculate** the best sleeping timing and can schedule the best way of sleeping and resting to reduce jet lag condition to the minimum.</br> 
In order to do all these things the AmI system is able to **control** some of the hotel bedroom “features”(lights, electric shutters, music).</br>
Moreover the AmI system **interacts** with the user in order to give him advices on the day schedule, suggesting some naps during the day, between the appointments, and have a real time feedback on his tiredness and in general on his feelings.</br>
