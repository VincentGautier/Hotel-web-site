To suceed in doing this project, we will need to get access to the smartphone of the user especially we will use the google agenda and the alarm menu. After that, we need to calculate, thanks to the data given by the user, the best way for him to sleep
and to accustom himself to the circadian rhythm of the region. We will need to use bluetooth or wifi technologie to control the lamps of the room and the blinders. We will also use a telegram bot, notifications of the phone or a microphone to interract
with the user.
